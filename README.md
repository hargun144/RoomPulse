# 🏫 Room Pulse — Real-Time Classroom Availability System

Room Pulse Now is a browser-based web application that solves the everyday problem of finding vacant classrooms on campus.  
It enables Students, CRs, and Faculty to view, update, and verify real-time room occupancy — eliminating confusion, manual coordination, and scheduling conflicts.

## 💡 Why Room Pulse Now?
On most campuses:
- Classroom updates happen manually  
- No central system shows which rooms are free  
- CRs rely on word-of-mouth  
- Sudden class changes create chaos  

Room Pulse Now brings:
- Real-time visibility  
- CR & Faculty–verified updates  
- Auto-expiring occupancy  
- Smart timetable-based predictions  
- A clean, fast dashboard for instant room lookup
